This is an audio sample sharing app for producers who want to upload small audio samples and share them

This was originally made with vite.js over at https://github.com/collectivenectar/soundslip, but I'm rebuilding it with nextJS!

This project is being made just like on my other version, only with a few changes: Graphql, postgresql, with an apollo server, and testing with jest!

I'm also looking to implement features I wanted to in the previous version but feel more comfortable doing with graphql, like
IPFS file storage, a web worker to add client side file encryption and key storage, and a more to come!
